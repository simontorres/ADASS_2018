\begin{abstract}

The Goodman Spectroscopic Pipeline (GSP) is reaching some maturity and
behaving in a stable manner. Though its development continues, we have
started a parallel effort to develop a real-time version of the GSP,
which aims at obtaining fully reduced data within seconds after the spectrum
has been obtained at the telescope.  Most of the required structure, algorithms and
processes already exist with the offline version of the GSP. The real-time or online
version differs in its requirements for flow control, calibration files, image combination, reprocessing, observing logging assistance, etc.
Here we present an outline of the route for implementation of a real time online version.

\section{Introduction}

The \emph{SOAR Telescope} is a 4-meter telescope located on Cerro Pach\'on, northern Chile. The \emph{Goodman High Throughput Spectrograph} (Goodman HTS) is an Imaging Spectrograph developed by the University of North Carolina, see \citet{2004SPIE.5492..331C}. Is the most requested/used instrument currently at the telescope with about 65\% of the time available on the sky. There is also another team working on an API and a Front End aimed to provide remote pseudo-automatic observation capability.


\section{Main Achievements}

Our offline data reduction pipeline does 

\section{Design Constraints}

For the live data reduction pipeline we want to get rid of the VNC system and move to a web-based service, this adds a whole new level of complexity but the results are worth the effort, the offline version of the pipeline exists as a single Python package but for the live version  we will need several other components.

\subsection{Data Reduction Package}

This is based on the Offline python package. The modifications required are intended to enable asynchronous data processing as well as controls, this could be achieved by adding a private REST API that would allow to modify the pipeline's settings needed to operate under different observing strategies, it has to be relatively simple allowing operation such as turn on or off file system event watching routines parse different settings, report errors.

Also, larger use of Astropy's packages is in our scope.

\subsection{Public REST API}
Publishing a web application is not a simple task with security been the biggest point of concern but the application has to be stable and reliable as well. Lucky for us there are plenty of tools that allow us to simplify these tasks


\subsection{Web Front End}

This template has no figures.
Look for the larger template and Makefile how to do this.
